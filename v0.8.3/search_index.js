Other features might get reduced in strength, eg. throwing exceptions will result in a trap.If your code is incompatible with GPU execution, the compiler will mention the unsupported feature, and where the use came from:julia> foo(i) = (print(\"can\'t do this\"); return nothing)\nfoo (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @cuda foo(1)\nERROR: error compiling foo: error compiling print: generic call to unsafe_write requires the runtime language featureIn addition, the JIT doesn\'t support certain modes of compilation.

    "text": "Not all of Julia is supported by CUDAnative. Several commonly-used features, like strings or exceptions, will not compile to GPU code, because of their interactions with the CPU-only runtime library.When not using GPU-incompatible language features, you might still run into this compiler error when your code contains type instabilities or other dynamic behavior. These are often easily spotted by prefixing the failing function call with one of several @device_code macros.For example, say we define and execute the following kernel:julia> kernel(a) = @inbounds a[threadId().x] = 0\nkernel (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @cuda kernel(CuArray([1]))\nERROR: LLVM IR generated for Kernel(CuDeviceArray{Int64,1,CUDAnative.AS.Global}) is not GPU compatibleWhen running with JULIA_DEBUG=CUDAnative, you will get to see the actual incompatible IR constructs.

In the future, we expect to be able to catch such errors automatically.If you want to dump all forms of generated code to disk, for further inspection, have a look at the @device_code macro instead."

This means that debugging generated code with e.g. cuda-gdb will be an unpleasant experience. Nonetheless, the PTX JIT is configured to emit debug info (which corresponds with nvcc -G) when the Julia debug info level is 2 or higher (julia -g2).We do however support emitting line number information, which is useful for other CUDA tools like cuda-memcheck. The functionality (which corresponds with nvcc -lineinfo) is enabled when the Julia debug info level is 1 (the default value). It can be disabled by passing -g0 instead."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "When optimizing code, it is important to know what to optimize. Luckily, the CUDA toolkit ships an excellent profiler, nvprof, with nvpp as the Eclipse-based UI. The CUDAnative compiler is fully compatible with these tools, and generates the required line number information to debug performance issues. To generate line number information, invoke Julia with the command-line option -g1. Using -g2 puts the PTX JIT in debug mode, which significantly lowers performance of GPU code and currently does not improve debugging.Although CUDAnative exports a @profile macro, it does not serve the same purpose as Base.@profile. Rather, it instructs the CUDA profiler to start right before the first kernel launch. This avoids profiling during the time Julia or CUDAnative precompile code, and result in a much more compact timeline view. If you want to use this feature, disable the nvprof/nvvp option to \"Start profiling at application start\". As with all Julia code, also perform a warm-up iteration without the profiler activated.For true source-level profiling akin to Base.@profile, look at nvvp\'s PC Sampling View (requires compute capability >= 5.2, CUDA >= 7.5). In the future, we might have a CUDAnative.@profile offering similar functionality, using the NVIDIA CUPTI library."

    "text": "When there\'s no corresponding libdevice function or PTX back-end intrinsic exposing the required functionality, you can use inline PTX assembly via llvmcall. This requires you to embed the PTX assembly in LLVM IR, which is often messy.If the source of the assembly instructions is CUDA C code, you simplify this task by first compiling the CUDA code using Clang, and adapting the resulting LLVM IR for use within llvmcall. For example, extracting the following function definition from the CUDA SDK:__device__ unsigned int __ballot(int a)\n{\n  int result;\n  asm __volatile__ (\"{ \\n\\t\"\n        \".reg .pred \\t%%p1; \\n\\t\"\n        \"setp.ne.u32 \\t%%p1, %1, 0; \\n\\t\"\n        \"vote.ballot.b32 \\t%0, %%p1; \\n\\t\"\n        \"}\" : \"=r\"(result) : \"r\"(a));\n  return result;\n}We can generate the following LLVM IR by executing clang++ -Xclang -fcuda-is-device -S -emit-llvm -target nvptx64 ballot.cu -o - (you might need to add some CUDA boilerplate):define i32 @_Z8__balloti(i32 %a) #0 {\n  %1 = alloca i32, align 4\n  %result = alloca i32, align 4\n  store i32 %a, i32* %1, align 4\n  %2 = load i32, i32* %1, align 4\n  %3 = call i32 asm sideeffect \"{ \\0A\\09.reg .pred \\09%p1; \\0A\\09setp.ne.u32 \\09%p1, $1, 0; \\0A\\09vote.ballot.b32 \\09$0, %p1; \\0A\\09}\", \"=r,r\"(i32 %2) #1, !srcloc !1\n  store i32 %3, i32* %result, align 4\n  %4 = load i32, i32* %result, align 4\n  ret i32 %4\n}Finally, we use LLVM.jl\'s @asmcall macro to inline this assembly and call it:function vote_ballot(pred::Bool)\n    return @asmcall(\n        \"\"\"{\n               .reg .pred %p1;\n               setp.ne.u32 %p1, \\$1, 0;\n               vote.ballot.b32 \\$0, %p1;\n           }\"\"\", \"=r,r\", true,\n        UInt32, Tuple{Int32}, convert(Int32, pred))\nend"
